# Summary

This about making the LG 360 VR Goggles usable with a normal DisplayPort outlet.

The LG360VR uses the "DisplayPort over USB-C" standard.
Our assumption is, that with little hardware effort, we can send a DisplayPort signal into it.

# Current State of things

- A passive PCB Adapter has been manufactured, though it doesn't work
- Currently in the process of analyzing USB-PD communication, to figure out if this is the problem
